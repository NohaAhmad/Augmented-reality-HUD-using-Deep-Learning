# Augmented-reality-HUD-using-Deep-Learning
  The project utilizes the power of deep machine learning to detect and classify the surrounding environment hazards for vehicle. This includes passers-by, traffic signs and other vehicles in road. The implemented system streams live scene of vehicle traffic augmented with hazards alerts detected through the virtual reality headset. The system also augments navigation, music player and phone calls. The goal is to give the driver un- preceded level of visual information to keep him safe on the road.
Object Detection Algorithm: YOLO9000
Framework: Keras
Dependencies: numpy, cv2, PIL, queue, socket, urllib.request, json, regular expression, datetime, threading, flask, http.client
